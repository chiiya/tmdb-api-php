It was the first of its genre on American television and in the world, and is the fifth-longest running American television series. Originally a two-hour program on weekdays, it expanded to Sundays in 1987 and Saturdays in 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007.\n\nToday's dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the late 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC's Good Morning America. Today retook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto that position for 852 consecutive weeks until the week of April 9, 2012, when it was beaten by Good Morning America yet again. In 2002, Today was ranked #17 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.",

He maintains an awkward and often antagonistic demeanor with his guests, asking them bizarre and inappropriate questions mixed with offhand non-sequiturs. Episodes often include a segment in which Galifianakis awkwardly interrupts his guests to promote a sponsor's product--examples include bananas, Need for Speed: Shift videogame, and Speed Stick deodorant. The series' theme music is Dave Blume's arrangement of Bernard Herrmann's Theme from Taxi Driver, which is on the original Taxi Driver soundtrack album but was not included in the film.",

En très peu de temps, il devient une véritable star et sa collaboration avec le réalisateur David Fincher donne naissance aux films cultes Seven, Fight Club et L'Étrange Histoire de Benjamin Button. Il tourne dans de nombreux autres succès comme Entretien avec un vampire de Neil Jordan, Ocean's Eleven et ses suites de Steven Soderbergh, Troie de Wolfgang Petersen, Inglourious Basterds de Quentin Tarantino et World War Z de Marc Forster. Au cours de sa carrière, il a reçu quatre nominations aux Oscars et cinq nominations aux Golden Globes, dont un remporté pour L'Armée des douze singes de Terry Gilliam en 1996.\n\nSex-symbol des années 1990, Brad Pitt est le premier acteur élu deux fois « Homme le plus sexy du monde » par le magazine People en 1995 et en 2000. Avec sa femme Angelina Jolie (rencontrée sur le tournage de Mr et Mrs Smith et qui a demandé le divorce en septembre 2016), il est le père de 6 enfants. Leur couple est très médiatisé dans les années 2000, y compris dans leurs actions humanitaires (à l'occasion notamment du tsunami de 2004 et de l'ouragan Katrina).\n\nÀ partir de 2002, il s'investit dans la production via sa société Plan B Entertainment avec des films tels que Les Infiltrés de Martin Scorsese et Twelve Years a Slave de Steve McQueen, qui ont chacun été récompensés par l'Oscar du meilleur film en 2007 et 2014, The Tree of Life de Terrence Malick, qui a reçu la Palme d'or au Festival de Cannes en 2011, ou des succès publics comme World War Z."

					"biography": "Brad Pitt Oklahomában született, de a Missouri állam béli Springfieldben nőtt fel. Középiskolás éveiben főleg sporttal foglalkozott, az iskolai tanács tagja volt és érdeklődéssel fordult az iskolai musicalek felé. A Missouri Egyetemen újságírást tanult (főleg reklám szakirányban), de ezen kívül különféle iskolai szórakoztató műsorokban is szerepet vállalt.  Tanulmányai befejeztével Kaliforniába költözött, ahol számos munkát vállalt. Kipróbálta a limuzin-sofőrködést, de szállított hűtőket is. Az el Pollo Loco nevű cégnél dolgozva még csirkekosztümben is feltűnt az utcán. Ridley Scott felfigyelt a fiatal srácra, és szerepet ajánlott neki a Thelma és Louise (1991) című filmjében, aki ezután lassan, de biztosan elindult a filmcsillagok útján. A 12 majom (1995) című, posztapokaliptikus alkotás miatt elutasított egy filmszerepet Tom Hanks-szel, végül azonban Terrry Gilliam filmje meghozta számára az első Oscar-jelölést.  Érdekesség, hogy 1997-ben készült filmje, a %% (1997) óta Brad Pitt nem teheti be a lábát Kínába.\n\nKarrierjének fordulópontját a Trója (2004) jelentette, melynek köszönhetően elfoglalhatta helyét az akciósztárok között. Ezt követte 2005-ben a Mr. és Mrs. Smith (2005), melynek forgatása során megismerkedett Angelina Jolieval, aki miatt elvált korábbi feleségétől.\n\nKarrierje során számos különböző műfajú filmben játszott, melybe éppúgy beletartoznak a hollywoodi szuperprodukciók (Megaagy – 2010), és a komoly színészi kavlitásokat igánylő alkotások (Becstelen brigantyk – 2009, Az élet fája – 2011). Két jelölést gyűjtött be az évek során: egyet a Benjamin Button különös élete (2008) című filmben nyújtott alakításáért, a másikat  a Pénzcsináló (2011) című drámáért.  1996-ban kezdődött kapcsolata Gwyneth Paltrowval, akivel 1997-ben szakítottak, majd 1999-ben feleségül vette Jennifer Anistont, akitől 2005-ben vált el. Jelenleg Angelina Jolie férje. Hat gyermekük van, két fiút és egy lányt fogadtak örökbe."
